# Patreon_Scrape
This project looks at the [Patreon Community](https://www.patreoncommunity.com/) and aims to analyze the data on the community's users (creators). Given that Patreon is a platform that is meant to [Put Creators First](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vx6AJDkKeBkM0oQg19yu4BL4JeUBDdu_4aav2WXGydQ/edit#slide=id.g810d418b9c_0_515), I wanted to take a look at the ongoing activity amongst the very own creators who use their platform. Through this, we may be able to find some interesting areas of activity or even areas of improvement through the uncovered trends.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing

In order to run the files, make sure to have the following libraries:
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
* [Numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Seaborn](https://pypi.org/project/seaborn/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/)

Then, clone this repository into your local machine and try running the driver, analysis, etc. yourself!
```
git clone https://github.com/wonchankim97/Patreon_Scrape
```

## Further Improvements

I think it'd be interesting to take a look at this data over time. Especially as Patreon continues to grow (talks of a possible IPO in the near future!), there should naturally be more users on this platform. It'd be interesting to see how the network of users change and if that changes any of the findings of the original analysis.

On the network note, I think it would be very interesting to create a network graph of the users on this platform, given that on the profiles of each user, we are able to trace stats about who they replied to, etc.
